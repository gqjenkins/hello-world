# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub. Oh, hello!
I am a finance and accounting professional by trade who has learned to code. I got frustrated not being able to get
things done on IT related projects.  I'm learning the language of developers so that I can be a more
effective bridge between the user community and developers.  I'll also be able to develop solutions for the
unaddressed needs of finance operations in various industries.  I have a particular interest in developing, 
data analytics for the entertainment industry.  Hello!
